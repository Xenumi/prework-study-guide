# Prework Study Guide Page

## Description

This project will contain helpful reference to go back on study on bascc coding material. This will motivate me by helping me better understand course material in a organized self-made project form. Going through this proccess has helped me better understand how baisc Web-Page structure works and better undestand what I will learn in the upcoming months.

## Installation

Project installation requires local connection to both a server and the local hardware (computer) to be in synch. Without up to date synch, changes that are made to code or branches will not reflect online and in collaboration sites like GitHub. It is important to have a deep understanding of local and online synch in order to make a project work.
We need to code, commit, pull and then push our changes into Github in onder for installation to be correct.
## Usage

Usage of the study guide will be crucial to learning by keeping me organized on school material. I have to make sure that I am able to navigate in the site. I have made sure that I have commited and push all the required changes in order for it to be bug free.
